# DevOpsDays.org 2.0 (Raging Yak)

Working repository for the 2.0 project of DevOpsDays

## What is this repo?

This project is to create a parallel development for building updates and refreshes to the code running the devopsdays website. The approach is "what is we were starting this in 2024?"

We need to keep the same functionality as the existing site, but we should not just copy/paste existing templates, etc. This is an opportunity to clean up the code, make it more maintainable, and potentially add new features.
